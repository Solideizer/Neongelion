# Neongelion
A cyberpunk themed first person shooter where the protagonist is trying to escape from the simulation which he lives in by using abilities such as slowing down the time

*Project is developed on Unity 2019.1.10f1* 

## **Implemented Features :** 
-  FPS Combat
-  Basic Enemy AI
-  Dash Ability
-  Ability to Slow Down Time
-  Different Weapon Types

## NOTICE:
- Main purpouse of this project was to implement a slow down time mechanic. After adding that mechanic I realized that this mechanic needs to be supported in some visual way in order to be more polished. In order to achive that I learned how to manipulate post processing stack at runtime using a script. You can read about it in my blog if you are interested.
